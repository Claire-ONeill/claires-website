                    <p class = "description"> 
                        I am currently a computer science and data science student at the University 
                        of Michigan, who is passionate about using technology to address 
                        climate change. I believe in using technology to help improve the world, 
                        using it as a tool to address complex problems that I feel most passionate
                        about. Using my skills as a data scientist, I have been able to complete a project 
                        that exposed the impacts of plastic pollution, using tableau to visualize 
                        the impacts on a global scale. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "description">
                        Professionally, I continue to work as a data science intern for IT Concepts, 
                        where my team is developing a tool to reduce toxic language in corporate 
                        documents. This work has allowed me to develop skills in natural language 
                        processing and machine learning. I was able to train a transformer to detect
                        hate speech which performed at an 88% accuracy. As I continue to work on this 
                        project, I hope to continue to strengthen my skills as a software developer 
                        as well as a data scientist. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "description">
                        In my free time I enjoy listening to music, working on personal projects, and 
                        continuing to develop my skills in graphic design. I currently serve as the president
                        and treasurer of the Michigan Intercollegiate Polo Club, where I am able to apply
                        my data science skills while managing our budget using Excel. I had the opportunity 
                        to organize a merchandise fundraiser that generated over $1,000 in revenue, allowing me to 
                        use my graphic design skills to design and market merchandise.

                        I am an incredibly ambitious student, with a unique background that has given 
                        me a wide array of skills that have prepared me to be successful in data science
                        and software engineering roles alike. I hope to continue to expand on my current 
                        skill sets through future projects and work opportunities. I am a passionate student 
                        who is excited to use my skills to make an impact.
