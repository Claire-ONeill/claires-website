                        I am a student at the University of Michigan studying data science 
                        computer science, who is 
                        passionate about using data to answer important questions. I hope 
                        to expand upon my current data science skills, and continue to 
                        explore the ways data can be used to address complex questions 
                        such as climate change. 

                        I am excited to find ways to bind my passions with my work. I am 
                        collaborative, team-oriented, and I love to work with others 
                        towards solutions. In my free time, I participate in equestrian 
                        sports, explore nature, and build my graphic design skills.
