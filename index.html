                        I am a DS and CS student at the University of Michigan who is
                        incredibly passionate about using her technical skills to answer 
                        important questions. I hope to continue expanding upon my current 
                        technical skills by working on projects I am passionate about. I 
                        want to continue exploring the ways that data can be used to 
                        address complex questions.
                        Looking for ways to continue to bind my passions with my work, I 
                        hope to continue finding innovative ways to solve complex 
                        problems. Incredibly collaborative and team oriented, I hope to 
                        get the opportunity to continue working towards innovative 
                        solutions.
