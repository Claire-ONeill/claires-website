                <p>This project involves recreating the classic sudoku game and hosting it on a webpage. This project helped improve my frontend development skills, while also allowing me to recreate a game that I have always enjoyed. The project used CSS, Javascript, and HTML to handle gameplay logic and host the game on a page on github.</p>
